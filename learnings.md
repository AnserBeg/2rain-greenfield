## Verify generated freeze metadata before tagging
Date: 2026-07-21
Why: G0-P6a found trailing blank lines in generated metadata after its first tag, requiring a corrected immutable commit.
How to apply: run `git diff --check` and the artifact verifier before tagging; if metadata changes, regenerate all inventories and manifest facts before the final tag. See `docs/execution/packets/G0-P6a.md`.
